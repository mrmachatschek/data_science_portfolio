    "This document analyses tourism-related data for a set of worldwide countries, aiming to find the optimal choice for an investment in this sector. From a set of 186 countries we use the method described by the **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** to identify the **Efficient Frontier** of the top 10 countries which yield the highest return for a given risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "For these 10 countries we analyse other external indicators such as investor protection, the cost of crime and terrorism, etc. and create a ranking for each indicator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, we calculate an  average ranking of these indicators and visualize the result in a summary table. Based on our fidings, the optimal countries to invest into are **Iceland, Qatar, and Georgia**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Iceland** shows stable scores for most of the indicators, only ranking below average for long-term growth of international arrivals and short-term volatility of tourism revenue. Investors should therefore expect some volatility in the short-term returns, but can expect stable and growing returns in the mid and long term. Iceland also ranks high in investor-friendly taxation, allowing investors to receive higher net returns on their investments. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Qatar** performs well in most indicators (relative to the 10 selected countries), but underperforms in terms of long and short-term growth of international arrivals, as well as long-term volatility of tourism revenue growth. It also ranks the lowest in investor protection - something potential investors should consider before making an investment decision. Nonetheless, even with fluctuating and decreasing short-term international arrival rates, investors can expect stable returns both in the short and long term, with easy access to loans and low interest rates in case that debt financing is considered for business investments. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Georgia** shows low rather low performance in terms of volatiliy of both international arrivals and revenue growth. Nonetheless, short-term return is above average and investors can expect most favorable protection policies. Indicators for investor taxation and access to loans rank rather highly as well, making it an attractive country for both foreign direct investment and debt financing of business investments. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: For a complete overview of all performance indicators, please refer to the summary table at the end of the document.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The three countries described above are highly attractive for investments in the tourism sectors, and should yield above-average returns with a reasonable risk. Nonetheless, other countries from the summary table could be considered as well, depending on each investor's individual priorities and risk aversion degree. "

    "With this project we aim to give a good overview of financial investment options in the tourism sector based on historical data. To begin with, we analyse tourism arrival and revenue data for various countries so as to choose 10 countries with investment potentials for further analysis. Furthermore, we analyse more external factors and create investment performance and risk indicators. Finally, we rank the 10 countries based on their average performance and recommend the top 3 countries.\n",

In ***section 3 - Analysis*** we extend our data with additional calculated measures and begin our analysis using several visual graphs. Finally, in ***section 4 - Conclusion*** we present our findings and recommendation. "

    "**Interpretation:** Although we can spot some outliers that disort our plot scales, we can easily zoom in to analyse the other countries as well.

    "One such outlier can be found in the first plot (*Arrivals: Growth rate and standard deviation last 23 years*): **Tajikistan** yields an enormous growth rate 61.500%, meaning that the **number of international arrivals in 2017 is 615 times higher than in 1995**. \n",

    "The scatterplots above give as a good indication of countries that yield a high return with a relatively low volatility. However, it is difficult to visually identify which countries have the best ratio between return and risk, thus we calculate a ***growth-to-standard deviation*** ratio (analog to a risk/reward ratio often used in financial settings). We apply the method used in the **Modern Portfolio Theory** to identify the Efficient Frotier of countries that yield the highest return for a given risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the two main indicators (international arrivals and tourism revenue) are still separated, not allowing us to draw any conclusion of their combined performance. Therefore, we create combined growth and variance measures, assigning equal weights to both indicators. Consequently, we examine the ratio between a country's growth in a given period (long-term: 23 years, mid-term: 10 years, short-term: 5 years) and the growth's standard deviation (SD). The higher the SD, the higher the volatility, therefore the riskier it is to invest in this country's tourism industry. \n",

As expected, the amount of revenue generated by tourism was also subject for a significant increase especially after 2005. Thus, the country's high volatility was not fortuitous but rather explained by the big rise of the 2 tourism indicators."

It's celarly noticeable that Qatar has much higher values of GDP in comparison to the other selected countries during the considered time period. However, it is also the country that suffered the most and sharpest upward and downward movements.\n",

We can see that, in general, all of them have a similar overall growth and, at the end, Dominican Republic is the best ranked, while Rwanda and Benim are the worst ranked among this set of countries."

    "**Interpretation:** The table shows a summary of all performance indicators for the 10 countries we selected using the efficient frontier method (based on the weighter overall SD/growth ratio). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Iceland, Qatar, and Georgia** rank the highest in our evaluation, yielding above-average short-term return and good overall marginal conditions, such as low business costs of crime and terorism, favorable interest rates, good infrastructure, and easy access to loan for debt financing. However, we can see that long-term return and volatility for Iceland is not optimal, ranking below average in our comparison. For this reason, investors should consider other countries in the table as well, based on their individual preferences and degree of risk aversion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Countries such as **Dominican Republic and Cambodia** show unfavorable external factors, e.g. low infrastructure scores, high business costs of crime and terrorism, but still experience a stable growth in both international arrivals and tourism revenue. As a consequence, these countries could be attractive investment targets as well, depending on the type of investment. \n",
